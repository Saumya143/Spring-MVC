1.IOC container is created.xml file is loaded.then it checks whether 
]the xml file is welformed or not and valid or not
2.then inMemory meta data of ApplicationContxt.xml file is created.
3.then  preInstantiation of singleton scope bean will take place
4.then it goes to applicationContext.xml file and founds all the two class are singleton scope then load
 the dependent class and create the object and store in internal hash map.
5.In BankService class also singleton scope but its having replace-method tag.
6.internally create inmemory proxey class in Cg library
7.on that proces object is created on that aware injection is happened
8.then it kept in internal hash map or cache
9.container calls the ctx.getBeans method
10.then it goes to the internal Hashmap and gets the proxey class object from the internal Hashmap
11.then it goes to the methodreplacerTest class and call the service.calcinterstAmount()
12.then it goes to proxey class and execute that method
13.After that it calss the reimplement method in proxey class
14.then it goes to the implement MethodReplace class and execute the logic 
15.it calculate the logic and return back to the proxey class
16.retValue will send the values to the client Application and displays the values.
